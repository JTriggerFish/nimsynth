Mini Music Studio
-----------------

Workspace similar to buzz where you lay out generator/effects/sequencers


1. SubSynth
  - 2 Oscs
  - 1 Filter
  - Amp Env
  - Filter Env
  - Glissando

2. FMSynth

3. Sampler
  - 8 channels
  - assign sfx to channel
  - volume

4. Looper
  - Records input and plays it back looped
  - Import external music file
  - Multiple loops
  - Can adjust speed/pitch/reverse/do glitchy stuff

5. Effects:
  - Delay
  - Distortion
  - Reverb
  - EQ
  - Chorus
  - Compressor
  - Flanger
  - Phaser

6. Sequencer
  - Add patterns, add columns that map to attributes of synths/samplers/effects.
  - Tell it which pattern to play
  - You can sequence sequencers

Sequencer1 -> Sequencer2 (some notes) -> MonoSynth

Sequencer1 tells Sequencer2 which patterns to play, and Sequencer2 tells MonoSynth which notes to play
A sequencer can control multiple different instruments

Sequencer1 -> Sequencer2 -> MonoSynth1
                         -> Sampler1
           -> Sequencer3 -> PolySynth1

Mini Music Studio
-----------------

Workspace similar to buzz where you lay out generator/effects/sequencers


* SubSynth
  - 2 Oscs
  - 1 Filter
  - Amp Env
  - Filter Env
  - Glissando

* FMSynth

* Sampler
  - 8 channels
  - assign sfx to channel
  - volume

* Looper
  - Records input and plays it back looped
  - Import external music file
  - Multiple loops
  - Can adjust speed/pitch/reverse/do glitchy stuff

* Effects:
  - Delay
  - Distortion
  - Reverb
  - EQ
  - Chorus
  - Compressor
  - Flanger
  - Phaser

* LFO
  - Binding: machine, param
  - Shape
  - Frequency
  - Amplitude

* Sequencer
  - Add patterns, add columns that map to attributes of machine.
  - Tell it which pattern to play
  - You can sequence sequencers

Sequencer1 -> Sequencer2 (some notes) -> MonoSynth

Each column of the sequencer maps to an attribute of a machine
	- Binding (machine: machineID, param: paramID, interpolation: ?)
	- Store as int
	- Note type  (-1 = ...), (-2 = OFF), anything else is note value
	- Param type (-1 = ...), (0x00 = min value) (0xff = max value)
	  - Show graph of value next to value

Sequencer1 tells Sequencer2 which patterns to play, and Sequencer2 tells MonoSynth which notes to play
A sequencer can control multiple different instruments

Sequencer1 -> Sequencer2 -> MonoSynth1
                         -> Sampler1
           -> Sequencer3 -> PolySynth1

Notes from snowglobe:
 - DONE: count ticks from 0
 - space for transport control rather than return
 - shift and left drag for connections (for buzz natives)
 - delay length of 0 crashes
 - mouse in pattern view
 - remove bindings
 - knob dragging more obvious
 - save and load buttons
 - preset naming, save and load buttons
 - preset menu
 - clone patterns
 - double click on box to show machine view
 - fix scrolling in sequencer and parameters
 - scrolling in menus
 - DONE: resizable window
